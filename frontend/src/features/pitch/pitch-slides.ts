But to protect our investors, the host must post collateral in staked Marinade SOL. They buy the energy daily to repay investors, while their staked SOL earns native yield. If they ever default, the collateral covers it.\n\nSecond, automated yield compounding through Kamino and RockawayX. The USDC dividends generated from energy sales don’t sit idle. They are automatically routed into institutional Kamino liquidity pools, compounding a second layer of yield on top of the physical energy returns.\n\nReal kilowatt cash flow, secured by staked collateral, multiplied by institutional DeFi.',
